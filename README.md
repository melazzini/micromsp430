# micromsp430

## What?

This is a c++ library for the msp430

This is my attemp to write a versatile, small, and relatively fast c++ library to work with the msp430g2553 and similar mcu.

## Motivation

My motivation is that I like the msp430 mcu but I really don't want to memorize the register names and other details. 
In addtition, I don't want to  have code duplication each time I write an application. I also don't know very well things 
like mspware and I don't have plans to learn it in the near future.

## Objevtives

The main objective is to write code to control all the peripherals, possibly with some limitations, which can be overcome
writing specific traditional c-msp430 code.

The second objective and possibly the easiest to achieve is to demonstrate a way to write simple c++ code to control mcu.

**Disclaimer**

I am not a C++ guru, nor a professional embedded designer so if you have a look at my humble code don't expect to much.
Despite that, I hope that this will be useful.
